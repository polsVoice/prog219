    <h1>Auto-Pull Quotes -- courtesy of Charles Dickens</h1>
      Exercise:
    <ol>
      <li>Retrieve all span tags marked as pullquotes</li>
      <li>Create a copy (jQuery clone) of each tag</li>
      <li>Assign the pullquote class to the tag copy</li>
      <li>Place the tag copy in front of the original span tag (the pullquote class already handles the appearance and positioning of the new pullquote tag)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Chapter 1. Fellow Travelers</h2>

    <p>'By George!' said Mr Meagles, 'I was forgetting the name itself. Why,
 she was called in the Institution, Harriet Beadle--an arbitrary name,
 of course. <span class="pq">Now, Harriet we changed into Hattey, and then into Tatty,</span> because, as practical people, we thought even a playful name might be a new thing to her, and might have a softening and affectionate kind of
 effect, don't you see? As to Beadle, that I needn't say was wholly out
 of the question. If there is anything that is not to be tolerated on
 any terms, anything that is a type of Jack-in-office insolence and
 absurdity, anything that represents in coats, waistcoats, and big sticks
 our English holding on by nonsense after every one has found it out, it
 is a beadle. You haven't seen a beadle lately?'</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2. Home</h2>

    <p>It was a Sunday evening in London, gloomy, close, and stale. Maddening
church bells of all degrees of dissonance, sharp and flat, cracked
and clear, fast and slow, made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous.
<span class="pq">Melancholy streets, in a penitential garb of soot, steeped the souls ofthe people</span> who were condemned to look at them out of windows, in dire despondency. In every thoroughfare, up almost every alley, and down
almost every turning, some doleful bell was throbbing, jerking, tolling,
as if the Plague were in the city and the dead-carts were going round.
Everything was bolted and barred that could by possibility furnish
relief to an overworked people. No pictures, no unfamiliar animals, no
rare plants or flowers, no natural or artificial wonders of the ancient
world--all TABOO with that enlightened strictness, that the ugly South
Sea gods in the British Museum might have supposed themselves at home
again.</p>
